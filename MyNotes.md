## void

In JavaScript, void is an operator.  It's a unary operator, meaning it operates on a single operand. 1   Its primary purpose is to evaluate an expression and then return undefined, regardless of the expression's result.

The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value, usually using void(0) (which is equivalent to void 0).
